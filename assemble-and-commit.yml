# This task merges all the configuration fragments into one file
# In this example it merges the common.conf.part and main.conf.part
# into the junos.conf file.
# If merging the files results in a new file being created then a handler
# is triggered to push the config onto the device.

# This handler (i.e. a task triggered by a notify) uses the junos_config
